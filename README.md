### Precise Integrative Analysis of Single-cell Omics

### Documentation

[PIASO documentation](https://genecell.github.io/PIASO/) 

### Current available functionalities

1. perform dimensionality reduction with GDR
2. integration of scRNA-seq datasets with GDR
3. integration of scRNA-seq data and MERFISH/Xenium data with GDR
4. normalization of scRNA-seq data with INFOG
5. selection of highly-variable genes in scRNAseq data with INFOG
6. a novel gene set scoring method
7. run clustering on selected cluster(s)
8. side-by-side cell embedding plots, e.g., split by Conditions
9. stacked violin plots for multiple features, including genes and cell metrics
10. and others

### Coming functionalities

1. preprocessing of scATAC-seq datasets
2. integration of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets (not replying on gene activities)
3. inference of cell type-specific gene regulatory networks
4. and others
